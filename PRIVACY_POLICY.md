**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Overview

PrompthaKCer ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

PrompthaKCer operates entirely locally within your browser. We do not:
- Collect, transmit, or store any personal information
- Send your prompts or data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Share any information with third parties

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage APIs:

### What We Store Locally

1. **Settings and Preferences**
   - Extension enabled/disabled state
   - Compression level preference
   - Custom rules you create
   - Site configurations

2. **Prompt History** (optional)
   - Original and optimized prompts
   - Optimization statistics
   - Timestamps

3. **Statistics**
   - Total prompts optimized
   - Total tokens saved
   - Rule usage counts

### Data Control

You have full control over your data:
- **View**: Access all stored data in Settings > Data
- **Export**: Download your history as JSON
- **Delete**: Clear all history and statistics
- **Reset**: Reset all settings to defaults

## Permissions

PrompthaKCer requests the following permissions:

## Third-Party Services

PrompthaKCer does not integrate with any third-party services. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your local device:
- Your prompts are never transmitted over the internet
- No server-side storage means no risk of data breaches
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data

## Children's Privacy

PrompthaKCer does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The extension is intended for general audiences.
